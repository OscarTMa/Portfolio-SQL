# 🎬 Netflix Catalog Analysis

## 📌 Project Description
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix's content catalog. The goal is to understand the content strategy by analyzing the ratio of Movies vs. TV Shows, identifying top content-producing countries, and visualizing the evolution of the catalog over the last decade.

## ☁️ Project Architecture
This project was deployed using a **Modern Data Stack** approach, moving away from local files to a fully cloud-based environment.

* **1. Ingestion:** Raw data (CSV) uploaded to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
* **2. Warehousing:** Data stored and processed in **Google BigQuery**.
* **3. Analysis:** SQL queries executed in the cloud using BigQuery Standard SQL.
* **4. Visualization:** **Tableau Public** connected via data extraction pipeline.

## 🔎 Key Insights
* **Content Dominance:** Historically, **Movies** represent about 70% of the catalog, though **TV Shows** have seen a significant increase in production since 2015.
* **Top Producers:** The United States, India, and the United Kingdom are the leading contributors to the platform's library.
* **Content Trends:** A sharp spike in content addition was observed between 2016 and 2019.

## 🛠 SQL Skills Demonstrated
* **Cloud Computing:** Navigating GCP Console and managing BigQuery Datasets.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling unstructured text data using `SPLIT`, `SAFE_CAST`, and `OFFSET` to extract numerical values from string columns (e.g., Duration).
* **Aggregation:** Using `GROUP BY` and `COUNT` to summarize large datasets.
* **Filtering:** Strategic use of `WHERE` clauses to handle `NULL` values.

## 🧠 Theoretical Concepts
